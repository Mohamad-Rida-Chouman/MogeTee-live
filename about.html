        <h3>Education:</h3>

        <p>
            After graduating from highschool in 2014, I started learning Biology at
            <abbr title="Lebanese University">LU</abbr>. With hard work, determination and a lot of caffeine, I managed to obtain a Bachelors degree in Biology. Looking back, I thought that it would've been better had I studied Computer Science instead of Biology. Thats why, for the sake of shifting my career without losing the past years, I decided to major in Bioinformatics for my Masters degree, and so I did! I obtained my Masters degree from
            <abbr title="Tarbiat Modares University">TMU</abbr>
            and was finally able to enter the world of programming. Hello world!
        </p>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
            I claim to be an otaku (a person who loves anime and that kawaii or cuteness japanese culture). Not addicted to it though, but I do find myself turning to anime when feeling blue. I used to play basketball; however, I mostly play football now since much more of my friends do play football, whereas the ones who used to play basketball suddenly disappeared. Sad.
